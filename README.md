# Tablytix Backend

Backend source for [Tablytix](https://tablytix.vercel.app)

# TODO
- [ ] Write a good README.md (including build instructions)
- [ ] Make devcontainer run alone (i.e without starting other services/devcontainers)
- [ ] Edit Dockerfile to install inside a virtual environment so we don't pollute requirements.txt when doing `pip freeze`
